# OctoAcme Project Processes - Overview

OctoAcme runs projects through a clear, staged lifecycle that begins with a light-weight initiation and one-pager, moves into detailed planning where a prioritized backlog and Definition of Done (DoD) are established, continues through iterative execution with CI-backed PRs and regular demos, and finishes with controlled releases and blameless retrospectives. The approach emphasizes small, testable increments, measurable success criteria, and clear ownership so teams can deliver value predictably and learn quickly.

Day-to-day delivery follows standard workflows: a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), small pull requests that link to issues and include acceptance criteria, automated CI checks (unit, integration, linting, and security scanning), and at least one reviewer approval before merging. Cadence includes daily standups for team-level blockers, weekly PM+PdM syncs for alignment, sprint demos/reviews, and regular delivery syncs to surface cross-team dependencies and risks.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Project Managers (PMs) coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications; Product Managers (PdMs) own outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and define success metrics; Developers implement features and tests; QA validates acceptance criteria and supports release verification; stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. The project artifacts that enable this work include the Project One-pager/Charter, backlog and release plan, risk register, acceptance criteria/DoD, and retrospective action items.

Quality assurance and release controls are built into the pipeline: automated testing and security scans gate merges, end-to-end smoke tests verify critical flows on staging, and release checklists require passing CI, documented rollback plans, and release notes. Incidents follow a defined escalation path and a blameless post-incident retrospective feeds improvements back into the backlog.
